# What was the hardest part of this assignment?
- For me the Hardest part was React component and basically stucking in making the state varibale sometimes it was easy somtime it was hard 
- for me their was a bit struggle in frontend part only, backend part was easy for me as I am much passinate about backend enjoyed working with this project

# How did you debug an error?
- While coding backend part I didn't find any error so i didn't to debug also.
- For frontend part few of the time I debug using chatgpt but honeslty speaking that I have not used much just for 3,4 debug in frontend only.

# What would you improve if you had more time?
- If I had more time, I would improve the UI/UX of the application by making the design more user-friendly and responsive. I would also like to add extra features such as editing posts, adding categories/tags in a better way, and implementing authentication so that only logged-in users can create or delete posts. These improvements would make the app more complete and production-ready.

# Setup 
- First of all i have made folders and install the dependencies that were coming to my mind as per this project

# Backend
- Done with the mongoDB connection string setup
- After that, tested that database is connected and server is running or not 
- made the Schema and first API post

# Creste api
- This is a post api to create new post 
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/

# Get api :
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/
- Now moving to created the get api which will fetch all the post from the db

# Get post by id :
-  http://localhost:4000/api/posts/:id
-  This api will fetch the perticular post from DB
  
# Delete post by id:
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/:id
- this is basically used to delete the post 


- All the APIs are tested in postman and doesn't face much isu while coding backend



# Frontend : 
- Since every setup was done already and installation of dependencies 
- Now moving towards building the frontend

- Edit the App.js and added some CSS and tested that app is running or not
- faced Some issue with package-lock.json re-installed the dependencies 


# Routing Setup
- Used react-router-dom for navigation between pages.
- Setup routes for Home (/), Create Post (/create), and Post Details (/posts/:id).
- Basic navigation bar created with links to switch between these routes.

# Styling
- Added a global CSS file and styled container, navbar, and buttons for a cleaner look.
- Made sure the layout looks simple and responsive.
