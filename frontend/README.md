# Setup 
- First of all i have made folders and install the dependencies that were coming to my mind as per this project

# Backend
- Done with the mongoDB connection string setup
- After that, tested that database is connected and server is running or not 
- made the Schema and first API post

# Creste api
- This is a post api to create new post 
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/

# Get api :
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/
- Now moving to created the get api which will fetch all the post from the db

# Get post by id :
-  http://localhost:4000/api/posts/:id
-  This api will fetch the perticular post from DB
  
# Delete post by id:
- http://localhost:4000/api/posts/:id
- this is basically used to delete the post 


- All the APIs are tested in postman and doesn't face much isu while coding backend



# Frontend : 
- Since every setup was done already and installation of dependencies 
- Now moving towards building the frontend

- Edit the App.js and added some CSS and tested that app is running or not
- faced Some issue with package-lock.json re-installed the dependencies
